###  In Task_5  :- Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports
                      Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Indian Premier League’
                      As a sports analysts, find out the most successful teams, players and factors
                      contributing win or loss of a team.

 ###  In Task_6  :- Prediction using Decision TreeAlgorithm
                      Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically.
                      The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to
                      predict the right class accordingly.
